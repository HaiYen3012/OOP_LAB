This is a test file for garbage collection in Java.
We are testing String concatenation using the + operator and StringBuffer.
The goal is to observe performance differences when dealing with large strings.
The more data we add, the slower the performance should become when using + operator.
StringBuffer should perform better as it avoids creating new objects on each concatenation.
Let's add more data here to make the file bigger and see how performance is affected.
The goal is to create a significant amount of garbage that will slow down the program.
