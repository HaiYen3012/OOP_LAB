Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?  

Answer: Yes, Java allows users to create multiple constructor methods for a class, 
        as long as the parameter lists are different, which helps Java distinguish between the methods. 
        This is known as constructor overloading.
